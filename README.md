## My process
I started with mobile first approach before desktop.
i implemented sass and added a bit of js.
It was all pure css and html.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learnt overflow hidden dont work on elements with absolute property declared on them because position absolute removes the element fome the page.
